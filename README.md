This is a project I am working on as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about). The general goal is to create a landing page, though you can find more specific details [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page). The theming of the website is left up to the student, and since I am currently obsessed with [Rivals of Aether 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2217000/Rivals_of_Aether_II/), I have decided to make the landing page of a fictional platform fighter coaching service.
